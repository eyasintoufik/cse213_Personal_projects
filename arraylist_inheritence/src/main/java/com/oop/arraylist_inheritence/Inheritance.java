    /*

 it is possible to inherit attributes and methods from one class to another. we group the "inheritance concept
" into two categories :
   subclass (child) - the class that inherits from another class
   superclass(parent) - the class being inherited form

To inherit from a class , use the extends keywords.


   inheritance represents the IS -A relationship which is also known as a parent child relationship

example:
    Class Vehicle{
        String name;
        int wheels ;
        int reg;
   }
   Class Car extends Vehicle{
        String brand;

   }


// final keyword
//abstrac keyword // Class abstrac User


 */

}
